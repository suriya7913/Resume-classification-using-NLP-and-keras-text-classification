# Resume-classification-using-NLP-and-keras-text-classification
This project is to implement resume classification using ML
The main objective of the project is to implement text classification and 
preprocessing the data with NLTK  to 
Expand Contractions,                                                                       
convert to Lower Case,
Remove Punctuations,
Remove words and digits containing digits,
Remove Stopwords,
Rephrase Text,
Stemming and Lemmatization,
Remove White spaces.

and then using autokeras text classification with optimal training
we have arrived better accuracy on test data
